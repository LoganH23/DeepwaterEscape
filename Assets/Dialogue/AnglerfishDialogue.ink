Well you sure are lost, aren't you?
What am I? How rude!
I'm an Anglerfish, obviously.

Any how, you said you're looking for a way back to the surface?
Well, I suppose I could help you, though you'll need approval from our king first.
How do you get his approval? Well through combat of course!
I'll take you to him now. Good luck!
